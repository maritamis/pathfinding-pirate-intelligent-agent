# Pathfinding Intelligent Agent 
This code uses a deep Q-learning algorithm to help the agent find the treasure through aa 8 x 8 maze. 
I was originally given the base code and I wrote the portion that completed the Q- learning implementation.

To reflect as I on when I was learning how to work with different machine learning projects, I think that computer scientists use computers to solve a range of problems and try to innovate new products. What they do is important because their purpose is to help people and enrich their experiences. 
I approach a problem as a computer scientist by trying to come up with innovative ways to solve them. I use all of the different technologies at my disposal to try and get the best result and then iteratively re-visit and work on my approach and plan. 

Part of my ethical responsibilities include making sure that hidden bias is not present in a system that I create. I need to be aware of the potential for bias and try to combat against it.
